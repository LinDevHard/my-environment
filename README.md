# My work environment
-------------------
## For whom

First of all, I post my configurations on github for `myself`. I have a habit of changing Linux distributions every year and a half years, changing everything and then spending two days setting up my environment, so I finally decided to upload the configuration here to quickly put it on and be happy.

But you can also borrow these configs `yourself` if you like (although I'm not sure anyone will come here)
